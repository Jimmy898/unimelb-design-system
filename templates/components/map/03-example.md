A basic map with a `data-grayscale` attribute added to make the base map grayscale. This sort of map is designed to be used where the map is not designed to be a primary feature of the page, but only provides a supportive role. 

```html
<div class="gmap__canvas" data-grayscale data-pin="-37.798535, 144.960605" data-latlng="-37.798535, 144.960605"></div>
```
<div class="gmap__canvas" data-grayscale data-pin="-37.798535, 144.960605" data-latlng="-37.798535, 144.960605"></div>
