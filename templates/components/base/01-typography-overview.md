# Typography

## CSS font stack
```css
/* Sans $ff-sans */
font-family: Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;

/* Fixed $ff-fixed */
font-family: Courier New, Courier, fixed;

/* Serif $ff-serif */
font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif;
```
The only non-websafe font is Roboto, which we serve via @font-face.

## Why Roboto

All print products of the University use Linotype Univers as default font. Due to a few issues with that particular font on the web (licensing, loading, etc...) we had to find a similar font that works better in the digital space.

Google's Roboto is not only created specifically for screens, it is also very similar to Linotype Univers. Furthermore it is also pre installed on most Android phones which eases the initial load in mobile networks significantly.
