## A note about the Site Map
// TODO: Make this an alert box once we have the classes.

> This is a mandatory global component that must be included on all sites created on the unimelb domain. Changes made to site map code will be applied globally across all sites using these templates. 

## About the Site Map

A key part of the global navigation, the site map exists to enable people using our site to easily find their way between significant parts of our website. 

Reflective of the top level site information architecture, the Site Map is accessible from every page using the new templates. 

## How to use the site map

You don't need to do anything to use the site map. It is included automatically in any page (as an additional navigation layer) using the new templates via progressive enhancement (injected into the page using javascript). It is also available as a static, stand-alone page in the event that javascript does not work.
