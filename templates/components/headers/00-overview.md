title: Headers
---
These headers are available in the design system:

- `.image` — auto height, with background image, gets expanded by content
- `.banner` — with background image
- `.with-box` — contains a white box with more text content, auto height, gets expanded by content

Every header can contain a wrapper div that determines how the content within the header is displayed.

## Images
We don't provide a default image because images should always be relevant to the content.

# todo: all the inner wrappers except the mid-align
- bottom align
- course thingos
- with filters

and:
- article headings
- with / without video
