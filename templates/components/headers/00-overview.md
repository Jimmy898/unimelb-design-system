title: Headers
---
<div class="jumpnav"></div>
These headers are available in the design system:

- `.image` — auto height, with background image, gets expanded by content
- `.banner` — with background image
- `.with-box` — contains a white box with more text content, auto height, gets expanded by content

Every header can contain a wrapper div that determines how the content within the header is displayed.

## A note on images
We don't provide a default image because images should always be relevant to the content.
