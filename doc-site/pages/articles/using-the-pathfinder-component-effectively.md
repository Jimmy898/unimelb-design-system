title: Using the pathfinder component effectively
hidden: true

[Pathfinders](/components/pathfinder) have been developed as a way to make it really easy for you to point people to 2-4 of your most important pieces of content. 

They are visually quite striking and are definitely seen when placed on a page. 

Pathfinders work best when the text, titles and links used are similar. This will give them approximately equal visual weight and therefore consideration when a user views them. Ideally the "Learn More" link should be descriptive of the content to be revealed on click. 

Pathfinders should not be stacked on-top of one another (eg. 3 in one row and 3 in the next row). If you find yourself doing this, please investigate the components library to find another suitable component. [Listings](/components/listings) and [base](/components/base) might be a good place to start.
