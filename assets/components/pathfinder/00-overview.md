title: Pathfinder
---
The pathfinder is used to funnel the user to a certain area and can have up to four boxes. If you would like one particular box to stand out above the rest, a class of ```prominent``` can be added.
<p class="alert-warning">Pathfinder boxes <strong>cannot be disabled</strong>. Either don't show the box at all, or create a page for the box and explain whatever needs to be explained (e.g. "This course is not yet provided." in a <a href="/components/notices">notice</a> at the top of the page)
