# Colours

The colours used on our website go a long way towards ensuring a consistent user experience and compatibility with the University of Melbourne brand. In many ways University Blue is as much a part of the university brand as the crestÂ itself.

In general, you should not need to customise the colours on your website and should use the default colour scheme provided. This page exists primarily as a reference for people looking to [contribute additional components to the templates](#).

## How to use colours

You do not need to do anything to make use of the colours referenced here.

On the web, colour choices are vital in ensuring the utility and accessibility of our websites as they impact contrast. Colours are also used to denote various types of functionality, so you will find these colours used throughout various template components (a good example is [buttons](buttons). For example, green is frequently used to denote a primary action that you would like someone to take.

## Things to avoid

You should avoid:

* Changing the colour of components either locally or globally (eg. making the logo red, or the body text green). Doing this damages our user-experience, brand consistency and could have an adverse impact on accessibility.
* Add colours to the palette. If you feel that a colour should be added to the palette, please request it using the [contribution process](#).
