<h2 id="why-headings">Why Headings are Important</h2>

* Headings give semantic and visual structure to web and print documents.
* Sighted users scan for big, bold text in order to get an idea of the structure and content of web pages.
* 57% of screen reader users use headings to navigate the page, whereas only 8.5% read through the contents of page.
* If headings are not included in the page, screen reader users are forced to listen to the entire contents of the page.

<h2 id="guidelines-for-usage">Guidelines for Usage</h2>

* Headings should be short and concise.
* Headings should only be used when followed by content.
* By reading the headings alone users should get a good idea of the page contents.
* Headings should be mainly used for page specific content, rather than content which appears on every page.
* Heading tags should not be used to change font size or add emphasis.
* Appearance and presentation of text should be controlled via CSS rather than heading tags.
* Heading levels can't be skipped i.e. you can't jump from h1 to h3.
* The contents of the h1 tag is of moderate importance to search engines.
* Keywords in h2 - h6 tags are of low importance to search engines, but are of key importance to screen reader users.
