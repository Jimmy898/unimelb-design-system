title: Tables
---
<div class="jumpnav"></div>
This component can be used to apply basic styles to tabular data. 

Rows or cells can be highlighted by applying the ```highlight``` class appropriately.

Tables should contain a ```thead``` and ```tbody``` at a minimum, and heading labels should make use of the ```scope``` attribute to denote where they apply. 

Content within tables can also be centered by applying the ```center``` class to the entire table.
