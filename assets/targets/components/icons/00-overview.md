<div class="jumpnav"></div>

There has been [a lot](https://css-tricks.com/icon-fonts-vs-svg/) of [discussion](http://ianfeather.co.uk/ten-reasons-we-switched-from-an-icon-font-to-svg/) in the industry about the best way of implementing icons on a web page. Icon fonts, such as [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/), are widely available and generally free to use, but have a high overhead and can be tricky to style efficiently.

We've decided to use raw SVG vectors, and include a minimal set within the design system.

Please note: this component will not work on IE8 and below, since it depends on SVG.
