title: Pathfinder
---
The pathfinder is used to funnel the user to a certain area and can have up to four boxes. If you would like one particular box to stand out above the rest, a class of ```prominent``` can be added.

To disable a pathfinder box and ensure that it can never receive focus (for accessibility purposes), use attributes <code>disabled</code> and <code>tabindex="-1"</code>.
