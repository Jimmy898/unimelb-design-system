title: Filtered listings

<div class="jumpnav"></div>

This component provides a way to list and filter items. Two levels of categorisation are available: <strong>sections</strong> and <strong>tags</strong>. Every item must belong to exactly one section and one tag, and it is up to you to choose unique names for your sections and tags.

<p class="alert-info">When <strong>naming sections and tags</strong>, we recommend that you use only <strong>lower-case letters</strong>, <strong>dashes</strong> and <strong>underscores</strong>. This will lead to more readable URLs if you end up using the <a href="#pre-select-filters">pre-selection feature</a> (e.g. <code>/page?section=example-section</code> instead of <code>/page?section=Example%20section</code>).</p>
