<div class="jumpnav"></div>

This component provides a way to list and filter items. Two levels of categorisation are available: <strong>sections</strong> and <strong>tags</strong>. Every item must belong to exactly one section and one tag, and it is up to you to choose unique names for your sections and tags.
