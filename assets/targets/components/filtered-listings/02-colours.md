<h2 id="colour">Colours</h2>

<p class="alert-info"><strong>Note:</strong> starting from v4, the colours are no longer bound to the tags, and the colour classes have been removed (<code>category[a-e]</code>, <code>undergraduate</code>, etc.)</p>

To <strong>associate a colour with a tag</strong>, use the <code>data-color</code> attribute on the tag's <strong>checkbox</strong> in the filters container. On page load, the colour will be automatically applied to every item with that tag.

<strong>Five colours</strong> are available: <code>green</code>, <code>bronze</code>, <code>silver</code>, <code>blue</code> and <code>yellow</code>. For design purposes, we recommend that you order your tags inside the filters container so that the sequence of colours matches the list above.
