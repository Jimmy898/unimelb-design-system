## Development environment

This app now runs on webpack, so ruby is required to run the documentation/demo site, and node is required to build the system.

    git clone git@github.com:marcom-unimelb/unimelb-design-system.git
    cd unimelb-design-system
    cp .env.example .env
    bundle install
    npm install
    foreman start -f Procfile.dev

The development server needs to run on 3 ports (node.js, webpack and rack) and will be available at [http://localhost:5001/](http://localhost:5001/)

## Deploying asset package

A precompiled package of all target builds can be created by running

    rake assets:build

The compiled output can be found under /assets/build

## Deploying to production

A static version of the site can be generated by running

    rake assets:export VERSION=*(semver tag)*

The complete static site will be built under /build/*(semver tag)*

This is how the site running on [http://web.unimelb.edu.au](http://web.unimelb.edu.au) is built.

The static server can be run locally with

    foreman start

(IE8 is not supported by the webpack devserver middleware, so you will need to build a static site for testing)
