# A process for building excellent @unimelb websites

Making excellent websites is difficult. There are hundreds of factors to consider, and all of them must interact seamlessly for a site to be pleasurable to use. It is our goal to make it so that the vast majority of web considerations have been taken care of - design, accessibility, standards compliance, heavy development - so that you can focus on the most difficult part of building a website: ensuring the structure and content have a strong purpose and meet your users needs. 

To aid you on this noble quest, we have created a range of resources to explore. Depending on what you are trying to do you may need all or only some of these resources.  

## STEP 0
**Start with why**
> Unless you know why your site needs to exist, you’ll end up simply adding to the noise.
