# The Templates

> Before you start building a website it makes sense to explore the starter-templates that are available to you. 

More than just HTML, CSS and Javascript, the templates are a comprehensive solution to building websites. By providing a wide-range of pre-constructed page type templates along with comprehensive guidelines around how to create content to populate these, you are left free to focus on the structure and content of your site and not the nuances of design and development.
