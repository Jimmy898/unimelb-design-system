# Start with why

> Unless you know why your site needs to exist, you’ll end up simply adding to the noise.

If your site does not have a clear purpose and reason for being, it will become an amorphous beast with many masters, serving none. Stop this from happening and question why any new site you’ve been asked to create needs to exist.

- Does this site have a clear audience? 
- Does this site have a clear purpose? 
- Does this site fit into the information architecture for the university website as a whole?
- Is there budget to maintain it over time? 
- Should this be an extension of an existing site? 
- Am I creating this site because it needs to be created, or because I just want to build something?
