      h2 Research
      p Find out user needs by doing research and get to know the audience you are talking to
    li
      h2 Get content

        |and start to layout the page on your table or whiteboard
    li
      h2 Code
      p Jump into code and build a prototype to test your layout, content and interactions
    li
      h2 Test early
      p Test your HTML prototypes as early as possible. You don't need to setup expensive formal user testing scenarios but you should start to test with your target audience as soon as possible in informal small testing sessions.
    li
      h2 Iterate
      p Your page will never be done. It is better to start with a very small and scoped feature set. After shipping the product you continue to improve and add features as needed, based on feedback from real users.
    li
      h2 Contribute
      p If you couldn't find an adequate component in the Design System and you had to come up with your own, please contribute it back. It is highly likely that someone else from the Universitie's web community could use your component as well.
