title: Using the tab component effectively
hidden: true

[Tabs](/components/tabs) are only suitable where you have 2-5 chunks of data to display, and where each of these chunks can be given a short, single word title. They are not a suitable design pattern where more than 4 items need to be displayed. 

Tabs should each contain a substantive amount of information (> 1 paragraph or equivalent non-text content) and not be used to display a single link (eg. Click a tab only to find "click here to do this One Thing"). Conversely if you find that a tab is super long, or contains a large amount of bandwidth-heavy content, do not use the tab component as this will cause the user to download a large amount of content which they may actually never consume. Instead consider splitting this content out into a seperate page that can be purposefully opened if it is desired. 

### For use on a homepage

Tabs should not be confused with your site navigation when used on a homepage, as it is likely that you will have a larger IA than can be communicated via 2-5 tabs. Instead, tabs are appropriate if you would like to showcase the most important content on your website to users and lead them deeper into your site structure to learn more. 

It is important to note that not every page on your website needs to be accessible from either your homepage or local navigation, indeed trying to make either your local navigation or tabs reflect your IA in its entirety is a poor design decision as it will likely confuse your user by giving them too much to think about before they can make an initial click decision.
